### Launch In Google Cloud

Every code sample and JSON recipe listed here is immediately available for execution using Google Cloud Shell.  The Google Cloud Shell will launch a virtual box with StarThinker code already on it.  It will also display this documentation in the Google Cloud UI.  This is ideal for using StarThinker once to execute a task.  For longer running jobs see [Recipe Corn Job](/cron/README.md) or [Deployment Script](/deploy/README.md).
